# Pokedex
Partial Recreation of the Pokedex from Pokemon.


This application is intented to only demonstrate the principles of Data Binding, Making REST API calls and Asynchronous programming in Android Kotlin.

I have simply created a scrollable list of all available pokemons using REST API calls from the https://pokeapi.co/ endpoint.

This endpoint only has GET calls for consumption.

When you tap on a pokemon in the list it presents the image of the selected pokemon. Most of the data is fetched asynchronously and presented using one way daat binding.


Note: In case you decide to use this kindly follow all the pokemon endpoint API rules shared by the service. This simple app is protected by the GNU General Public License.
